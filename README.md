Hi, I'm [@avstics](https://github.com/avstics)!
-
I'm a programmer, I can code in [LUA](https://www.lua.org/), Javascript, [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) etc!


I absolutely love to mess around with [Roblox's Github Files](https://github.com/roblox) hehe

[Roblox Profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/908498774/profile), cause why not? If I'm gonna interfere with Roblox's Github Files, then I **should** have a Roblox profile!

[Github](https://github.com/avstics) because, If I want to interfere with *ANYTHING* on Github, It tells me, **"I've gotta log in to view this repository"** and, I'm too lazy to make a Github account, but I made one now!

Yeah that's me, avstics,
And I'm **OUT**!
